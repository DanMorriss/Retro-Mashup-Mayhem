## Game Goals

Defeat the Enemies: Players must navigate through various time periods, combating waves of enemies with precise shooting and evasive maneuvers. Each defeated enemy contributes to the player's score and progression.

Unlock Power: Scattered throughout the levels are powerful artifacts that, when collected, restore the player's health or provide temporary invincibility. Players must strategically manage their power-ups to maximize their survival chances.

Side-Scrolling Adventure: The game follows a side-scrolling format, immersing players in visually captivating environments as they journey through different eras. Careful navigation and quick reflexes are essential to overcoming obstacles and adversaries.

Reach the High Score: The primary goal is to achieve the highest possible score by eliminating enemies and successfully progressing through the levels. Players can compete against their own best scores or challenge friends to top the leaderboard.

Limited Lives: Players begin with a limited number of lives. Colliding with enemies or environmental hazards reduces their life count. Efficiently using power-ups and mastering evasion tactics are vital for survival.

Level Progression: As players defeat enemies and traverse through levels, the game becomes progressively more challenging. New enemy types and obstacles are introduced, requiring players to adapt and refine their strategies.

Random Movement: Enemies exhibit unpredictable movement patterns, ensuring that each encounter remains fresh and demanding. This randomness adds an element of surprise, making it necessary for players to stay alert and adaptive.
